    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Siphosethu Nzama, and I am 24 years old. I was born and raised in
        Durban, KwaZulu-Natal. Currently, I am completing a degree in Software
        Engineering with ALX Africa. I am passionate about learning and continuously
        improving my knowledge and skill set to become a more competitive candidate in the
        job market.
        Throughout my academic journey, I have demonstrated strong leadership, teamwork,
        analytical, planning, execution, and problem-solving skills. I believe that the
        competencies I have gained during my studies, combined with my eagerness to
        learn and grow, will make me a valuable asset in the workplace.
        I look forward to entering the professional world and showcasing what I have to offer
        while also learning from experienced industry professionals.
